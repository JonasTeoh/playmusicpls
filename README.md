**NOTE**: I only modified the original code, I do not actually know how the things work on a different level

**You would need**:  

                    pip install discord
                    pip install asyncio
                    pip install yt-dlp
                    pip install dotenv
                    
**Note**: if pip install dotenv doesn't work, try pip install python-dotenv
